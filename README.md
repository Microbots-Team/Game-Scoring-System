## 📅 Project Timeline & Context

- **Event:** FMEE 2025 – **AI & Robotics Club** Open Day
- **Date:** November 10–11–12, 2025

## 💡 Project Overview
The **Game Scoring System** is designed to manage visitor attendance and track scores during exhibitions or events.  
Each visitor logs in via a unique **QR code**, allowing the system to record their participation and game performance.

The system includes:
- An **Admin Dashboard** for managing users, scores, and settings.
- A **Visitor Page** where participants can view their personal data and total points.
