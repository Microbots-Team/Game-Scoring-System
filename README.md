# 🎯 Game Scoring System

## 💡 Project Overview
The **Game Scoring System** is designed to manage visitor attendance and track scores during exhibitions or events.  
Each visitor logs in via a unique **QR code**, allowing the system to record their participation and game performance.  

At the end of the event, a **leaderboard** displays the top-scoring visitors in real-time.  
The system includes:
- An **Admin Dashboard** for managing users, scores, and settings.
- A **Visitor Page** where participants can view their personal data and total points.
